## Summary

How great are optics?
They provide us with an easy interface with extracting information.
But not only a for extracting (getting) we can also use other methods such as `set` or `modifyF` to return new instances.

Documentation for the optics types:

- [`Lens`][lens-link]
- [`Prism`][prism-link]

Moving forward, we can begin to see how optics will come in handy when we begin to explore a search space.
In the next chapter we will test our newly acquired skills as we begin to put everything together.

Optics in CILib use `Lens` and `Prism` that allow us *zoom* in on instances to retrieve information or create new instances.
