## Summary

We explored every aspect of `Entity`.
And to reiterate

<div class="callout callout-info">
An `Entity` is a simple structure that contains and manages two very
specific things:

- A `Position[A]` within the current search space of the problem
- A "state" that contains all addition data required by the `Entity`
  which is not managed by the `Position[A]`.
</div>

But wait! We were introduced to two things we had not seen before.
That being

- `Step`
- `Environment`

Now, if you are asking "What are those?"
Fear not as we find out in the next chapter of "A Guide to CILib"!
