## Summary

Well done!
We have successfully implemented a genetic algorithm using CILib.
Whats great is that the code is easy to reuse.
I encourage you to modify the code and really make it your own.
If, for whatever reason, you got stuck during the example here is the [link][ga-example-link] to where the example was based off.
And for more example of CILib implementations you can view the example package [here][example-package].
