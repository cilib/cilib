## Summary

Hey, that wasn't as scary as we thought it would be.

<div class="callout callout-info">
`Step` is nothing more than a data structure that hides the details of a

</div>

We also learnt some valuable skills in this chapter such as: 

<div class="callout callout-info">

- We can use for comprehensions to chain together steps of an algorithm.
- How to can compare two `Entities` in a step.

</div>

But what if I told you `Step` has a sibling?
*gasp*.
In the next chapter we are going to look at `StepS` which represents a step with a state.
