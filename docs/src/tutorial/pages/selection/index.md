# Selection

At some point during our computational intelligence we will need to make selections on entities.
Such as a tournament selection used in a genetic algorithm.
Now luckily, CILib has several selection methods available for us to use.
Thus, this chapter's focus is going to be looking at how we can make use of these methods.
