## Summary

We learnt about some amazing functionality of CILib with regards to fitness.
We got to test our knowledge of CILIb thus far by figuring out how to build a deadly custom bow and arrow.
Its important to see how the various data types are starting to connect to one another.
And with the data types defined for us, we only need to implement the finer details specific to our problem.

They key take away points from this chapter are that

- By using pattern matching on `Feasible`, `Infeasible` and `Adjusted` we are able to control the logic as well as the validity of our solutions.
- We can define an optimization scheme, `Max` or `Min`.
- Using the optimization scheme, we can begin to compare solutions (preferably `Feasible`).
