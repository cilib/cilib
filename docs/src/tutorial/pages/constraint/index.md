# Constraint

As we begin to explore more of the core concepts of CILib we start to see how they are utilized by other concepts.
With this in mind, you might see types specific to CILib you haven't come across yet.
Dont worry, these will be explained in their appropriate sections later in the book.
In this chapter we are going to look at `Constraint`.
`Constraints` are used to place, you guessed it, constraints on random variables.
`Constraint` provides us with several types as well as a companion object for us to use.
