# Getting Started with CIlib

CILib is software library which aids in the experimentation and research of Computational Intelligence algorithms.
The library was created through a combined effort by several researchers.

<!-- ## Principled design -->

<!-- Pure functions operate only the passed in function parameters and return a value. -->
<!-- Given the same set of function parameters, the same result from the function is expected and is known as _referential transparency_. -->
<!-- It is very important to ensure that the library code is pure: it reduces complexity. -->
<!-- Due to pure functions only returning values, it allows for the controlling of effects. -->
<!-- Effects are actions that a program perfroms to achieve a goal. -->
<!-- One of the primary effects managed by CIlib is the effect of randomness applied to other values. -->
<!-- As a consequence of this, and other aspects, CILib makes an active effort to address the following: -->

<!-- - **Correctness**: All algorithmic components should be correct and operate as intened, doing nothing more. -->
<!--   Peer-review is hugely valuable, providing confidence that the implementations are correct and sound. -->
<!-- - **Type safety**: The use of types is a fantastic way to ensure that a program cannot represent invalid states. -->
<!--   This removes a huge set of potential errors and ensures greater confidence, as the compiler is always double-checking the code.q -->
<!-- - **Reproducibility**: The abiltity to reproduce the work of another researcher is a fundamental part of the scientific method. -->
<!--   With effects such as randomness applied to algorithms, reproducing results becomes much, much more difficult. -->
<!--   It is, therefore, required that CILib be able to provide the perfect replication of experimental work. -->

<!-- With all this in mind, we can think of CILib as a platform that allows us to build a project by combining a number of components that are reinforced by type safety to ensure correctness, whilst allowing for easily reproduced results. -->
