# Moving forward

What an adventure!
From the humble beginnings of `RVar` too creating a GA consisting of various CILib components.
We explored every corner of the CILib core library, but also made use of some of the other libraries, such as exec.
With this knowledge you are more than equipped to start making progress on your computational intelligence endeavours.
However, this is not all CILib has to offer. In the next part of the book we will be looking at:

* Benchmarks
* GA
* PSO
* DE

The above mentioned are all additional libraries within CILib that we can add to our sbt project.
I do recommend exploring these to gain a full understanding of what CILib has to offer.
You may also jump between chapters as they are all independent from each other, so you may start at whatever chapter interests you the most.
These chapters are focused on providing an explanation of how to use the algorithms, their parameters and return types as well as any other library specifics.
At times it will feel more like documentation than the tutorial themed "The Core and Soul of CILib", so keep that in mind.
For example, you'll often see an algorithm as a heading with its parameters and return types as sub headings.

Lastly, it's important to remember that this book isn't just a tutorial but also documentation of the whole of CILib.
So if you encounter a problem, or need help figuring out what a method or class does, you're more than likely to find an answer in this book.
If you still need help you can came chat on the [gitter][gitter-link].

I hope you enjoyed this first part of the book!
