# Runner and Our First Algorithm

In this chapter we are going to create our very own Genetic Algorithm.
But there are a few things we are going to have to discuss first before we jump into the creating a GA.

CILib offers a data type that we may use to run our algorithms.
I say "may" because, if so choose, you create your own way of running the algorithms.
This data type is called `Runner`.
`Runner` isn't a part of the cilib-core, but is included in this part of the book because it is needed to demonstrate everything we have learnt.
In order to include `Runner` to your project you need to add `cilib-exec` as a dependency in your `build.sbt`.

And since we are creating a GA we should also include `cilib-ga`.
The reason we are creating a GA rather than, let's say,
a PSO is that the ga package uses types we have seen before where as a PSO uses types exclusive to the PSO package (W=we will explore these later).

Your library dependencies should look very similar to the following...

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "net.cilib" %% "cilib-core" % "@CILIB_VERSION@",
    "net.cilib" %% "cilib-ga" % "@CILIB_VERSION@",
    "net.cilib" %% "cilib-exec" % "@CILIB_VERSION@"
)
```

Once you have refreshed your project we can start looking at what `Runner` is.


## What is Runner?

`Runner` is an object within CILib that allows us to control the execution of our algorithm.
It provides us with methods that allow us to specify the:

- Number of iterations the algorithm should run for.
- The algorithm.
- The entities in the search space search space.

Pretty cool, hey?
These are the discussed methods.

```scala
repeat[F[_],A,B](n: Int, alg: Kleisli[Step[A,?],F[B],F[B]], collection: RVar[F[B]]): Step[A,F[B]]

repeatS[F[_],A,S,B](n: Int, alg: Kleisli[StepS[A,S,?],F[B],F[B]], collection: RVar[F[B]]): StepS[A,S,F[B]]
```

"Woah, that looks intimidating".
Sure, it definitely can appear that way so let's try to clarify it a bit.
The difference between the algorithms is simply that the one is dealing with `Step` and the other `StepS`.
So you would choose which repeat method based on the type you used in your algorithm.
As for the parameters, `n: Int` is the number of iterations the algorithm should run for.
And `collection: RVar[F[B]]` are our *entities* in our search space.
Now the second parameter is something we haven't come across yet.
All it is saying that we need an iteration type based on the algorithm.

### Iteration

`Iteration` is an object defined within `cilib-core` that will create an *iterator* of our algorithm.
An *iterator* simply means are we running our algorithm synchronously or Asynchronously.

```scala
sync_[M[_]:Applicative,A,B](f: NonEmptyList[A] => A => M[B]): Kleisli[M,NonEmptyList[A],NonEmptyList[B]]

async_[M[_]: Monad,A](f: NonEmptyList[A] => A => M[A]): Kleisli[M,NonEmptyList[A],NonEmptyList[A]
```

These methods are very *raw* and generic.
They are made public so that if you ever wanted to perhaps make your own iterator you could make use them if you desired so.
The following methods use the *raw* and generic methods to create something we are a bit more familiar with.

```scala
def sync[A,B,C](f: NonEmptyList[B] => B => Step[A,C]) = sync_[Step[A,?],B,C](f)

def syncS[A,S,B,C](f: NonEmptyList[B] => B => StepS[A,S,C]) = sync_[StepS[A,S,?], B,C](f)

def async[A,B](f: NonEmptyList[B] => B => Step[A,B]) = async_[Step[A,?], B](f)

def asyncS[A,S,B](f: NonEmptyList[B] => B => StepS[A,S,B]) = async_[StepS[A,S,?], B](f)
```

As we saw with runner we are given methods to handle both `Step` and `StepS` based algorithms.

### Conclusion

This may be a lot to take in.
If so don't worry as we are now going to create a `GA` from start to finish!


## Creating a GA

Isn't this exciting!

All our work over the past chapters is coming together!

It should be noted that the only thing we will be using from
`cilib-ga` is the type `Individual`, which, as we discussed before, is
an `Enity` with a state of type `Unit` since GA's do not need a state.

### Imports

We will be using the following `imports` for our GA.

```scala :silent
import cilib._
import cilib.ga._
import scalaz._
import Scalaz._
import eu.timepit.refined.auto._
import spire.implicits.{eu => _, _}
import spire.math.Interval
```

### The Problem Environment

For our problem we are going to attempt to find the greatest area
produced by a 2 dimensional rectangle. The sides can range from 0.1
to 12.

```scala
val bounds = Interval(0.1, 12.0)^2

val env = Environment(
    cmp = Comparison.dominance(Max),
    eval =  Eval.unconstrained[NonEmptyList,Double](pos => Feasible(pos.foldLeft1_ * _))).eval
)
```

### The GA Algorithm

The GA algorithm is the exact same one used in `cilib-ga`.

The reason we are intentionally defining it as opposed to importing it
is so that we can see the inner workings and learn from it.

```scala
def ga[S](
             p_c: Double,
             parentSelection: NonEmptyList[Individual[S]] => RVar[List[Individual[S]]],
             crossover: List[Individual[S]] => RVar[List[Individual[S]]],
             mutation: List[Individual[S]] => RVar[List[Individual[S]]]
         ): NonEmptyList[Individual[S]] => Individual[S] => Step[Double,List[Individual[S]]] =
    collection => x => for {
        parents   <- Step.pointR(parentSelection(collection))
        r         <- Step.pointR(Dist.stdUniform.map(_ < p_c))
        crossed   <- if (r) Step.pointR[Double,List[Individual[S]]](crossover(parents))
        else Step.point[Double,List[Individual[S]]](parents)
        mutated   <- Step.pointR[Double,List[Individual[S]]](mutation(crossed))
        evaluated <- mutated.traverseU(x => Step.eval((v: Position[Double]) => v)(x))
    } yield evaluated
```

Wow. There is a lot going on here.
Let's break it down.
First the parameters:

```scala
p_c //is our crossover rate
parentSelection //is the function we will use to select the parents
crossover //is the function that we will use to produce off spring
mutation //is the function we will use to mutate the offspring
```

All right. Not too bad. By being able to pass functions to a generic
GA method allows us to build a GA specific to our needs. It should
also be noted that all the passable functions yield the same data
type. Now before we move to the actual implementation of the `ga`
method, I would like to remind you that for comprehensions are
essentially chained `flatMaps`. This allows us to chain steps
together. So we know that this method will return a function of type

`NonEmptyList[Individual[S]] => Individual[S] => Step[Double,List[Individual[S]]]`

Which in simply means, that we are going to get a function that return
a `Step` representing a series of computations applied to every
`Individual` with a collection of `Individuals`. Okay, so now we know
what we are returning but let's see how we get to that by looking at
the "series of computations".

`parents <- Step.pointR(parentSelection(collection))`

Here we are selecting our parents from the collection using the
parentSelection function that was passed as a parameter. Lastly, it
will be wrapped in a `Step`.

`r <- Step.pointR(Dist.stdUniform.map(_ < p_c))`

Here we are assigning a `Boolean` wrapped in an `Step`.

```
crossed <-
  if (r) Step.pointR[Double,List[Individual[S]]](crossover(parents))
  else Step.point[Double,List[Individual[S]]](parents)
```

If r is `true` we will produce crossovers based on the `parents` using
the crossover function parameter, else we are going to just leave the
parents as is. How frequently the crossover occurs depends on your
`p_c`.

`mutated <- Step.pointR[Double,List[Individual[S]]](mutation(crossed))`

Nothing too complex here. We are simply mutating our ``crossed``
individuals using the mutation function parameter. Also note that
``mutated`` will have a data type very similar tto our return type.

`evaluated <- mutated.traverseU(x => Step.eval((v: Position[Double]) => v)(x))`

Lastly, we are taking every `Individual` from `mutated` and wrapping
each one in an evaluation `Step`. Remember that this is just a step
representing evaluation, not actually evaluating the `Individuals`
right now.

Let's get to creating the functions we will be passing to our ga method.

### Selection Method

For our selection method we will be creating a random selection
method. We know that it needs to have the type
`NonEmptyList[Individual[S]] => RVar[List[Individual[S]]]`. To make
this even easier to read we can include a custom type, `type Ind =
Individual[Unit]`, making it `NonEmptyList[Ind] =>
RVar[List[Individual[S]]]`. Create a function with the name
`randomSelection` that will randomly select two `Inds` from an non
empty list.

<div class="solution">

```scala :silent
type Ind = Individual[Unit]
```

```scala
val randomSelection: NonEmptyList[Ind] => RVar[List[Ind]] =
    (l: NonEmptyList[Ind]) => RVar.sample(2, l).map(_.getOrElse(List.empty[Ind]))
```

</div>

### Selection Method

For our selection method we will be creating a random selection
method. We know that it needs to have the type
`NonEmptyList[Individual[S]] => RVar[List[Individual[S]]]`. To make
this even easier to read we can include a custom type, `type Ind =
Individual[Unit]`, making it `NonEmptyList[Ind] =>
RVar[List[Individual[S]]]`. Create a function with the name
`randomSelection` that will randomly select two `Inds` from an non
empty list.

<div class="solution">

```scala
val randomSelection: NonEmptyList[Ind] => RVar[List[Ind]] =
    (l: NonEmptyList[Ind]) => RVar.sample(2, l).map(_.getOrElse(List.empty[Ind]))
```

</div>

### Crossover Method

We will be creating a one point crossover method to be used in our GA.
It will need to have the type `List[Individual[S]] =>
RVar[List[Individual[S]]]` and let's call it `onePoint`. There should
be two `Individuals`, parents, in the list that will be used to create
two new `Individuals` from a one point cross over. Else we should
output an error.

<div class="solution">

```scala
def onePoint(xs: List[Ind]): RVar[List[Ind]] =
    xs match {
        case a :: b :: _ =>
            val point: RVar[Int] = Dist.uniformInt(Interval(0, a.pos.pos.size - 1))
            point.map(p => List(
                a.pos.take(p) ++ b.pos.drop(p),
                b.pos.take(p) ++ a.pos.drop(p)
            ).traverse(_.toNel.map(x => Entity((), Point(x, a.pos.boundary)))).getOrElse(List.empty[Ind]))
        case _ => sys.error("Incorrect number of parents")
    }
```

</div>

### Mutation Method

Our mutation method will be relatively simply. For every `Individual`
we want to mutate its position where each point in the position is
mutated based on a `Boolean`. If It is true, mutate the point by
multiplying by a random number from a gaussian distribution. Else
leave it as it is. This deciding `Boolean` is determined the same way
r is in our `ga` method. Except, that is compared with a double
parameter, `p_m`, representing the mutation rate. So you might need
groups of parameters. Call this method `mutation` and be aware of
it's return type. Also some helpful hints are to think about using
`Lenses` and the `ModifyF` function, as well as `traverse` for
sequencing through points ot a list.

<div class="solution">

```scala
def mutation(p_m: Double)(xs: List[Ind]): RVar[List[Ind]] =
    xs.traverse(x => {
        Lenses._position.modifyF((p: Position[Double]) => p.traverse(z => for {
            za <- Dist.stdUniform.map(_ < p_m)
            zb <- if (za) Dist.stdNormal.flatMap(Dist.gaussian(0,_)).map(_ * z) else RVar.point(z)
        } yield zb
        ))(x)
    })
```

</div>

### My GA

Now that we have defined all those methods we should be able to
construct our GA with the following line of code:

`val myGA = ga(0.7, randomSelection, onePoint, mutation(0.2))`

Great! Remember that what we have here is still just a function. One
that takes a collection of `Individuals` and returns a `Step`.

`NonEmptyList[Ind] => Ind => Step[Double,List[Ind]]`

### Creating a Collection

We have the `myGA` function, but not the collection. So let's go ahead and
create that. Keep in mind that we are dealing with `Individuals`

```scala
val swarm = Position.createCollection[Ind](x => Entity((), x))(bounds, 20)
```

### Creating an Iterator

Here is where things get a little more interesting. Remember the
`Iteration` section earlier in this chapter? Here is where we dive
into that. I'll first present the code and then we can go over it.

```scala
val iterator =
    Iteration.sync(myGA).map(_.suml)
      .flatMapK(r => Step.withCompare(o =>
        r.sortWith((x,y) => Comparison.fittest(x.pos,y.pos).apply(o)))
          .map(_.take(20).toNel.getOrElse(sys.error("error"))))
```

This code creates a synchronous iterator based on our ga that at each
generation select the best 20 based on our comparison dominance.
`Iteration.sync(myGA).map(_.suml)` allows us to work with a
`List[Ind]`. `r` is an `Ind` which becomes a `Step` with a
comparison.

### Running our GA

Lastly, running our program requires a `Runner`.

`println(Runner.repeat(1000, iterator, swarm).run(env).eval(RNG.init(12L)).toString)`

This line of code will produce the results of our ga after 1000
iterations as a string.

## Summary

Well done!
We have successfully implemented a genetic algorithm using CILib.
Whats great is that the code is easy to reuse.
I encourage you to modify the code and really make it your own.
If, for whatever reason, you got stuck during the example here is the [link][ga-example-link] to where the example was based off.
And for more example of CILib implementations you can view the example package [here][example-package].
