# About This Book

This book is aimed at walking you through the different components of
CILib (Computational Intelligence Library). CILib is written in Scala,
if you don't have any experience with Scala I would recommend first
learning the language and getting a good idea of what Scala is and how
it works. To do this I would recommend Essential Scala and Scala With
Cats by the team over at [Underscore][link-underscore].

Along with theory explanations of what certain components do, the book
will also include code to demonstrate an example of use. In a way,
this book will also serve as documentation by example for CILib.

During this book we will be covering four major sections:

- Setting up CILib
- Learning the core components
- Learning about algorithm implementations
- Working through some examples

As we cover each section you will begin to learn how components work
and where to use them.  After all this, you will be more than ready to
start implementing your work using CILib.

## What is CILib?

CILib is software library which aids in the experimentation and
research of Computational Intelligence algorithms. The library was
created through a combined effort by several researchers. The project
originally was called PSOlib as it focused on the PSO algorithm, but
over time had additional contributions outside of the PSO area and the
project was renamed to CILib.

### Principled design
It is very important to ensure that the library code is pure - thereby
reducing complexity. This has many advantages but, most importantly,
it allows for the controlling of side-effects which is a primary
concern, especially when randomness is involved. As a consequence of
this, and other aspects, CILib makes an active effort to address the
following:

- **Correctness**: All algorithmic components should be correct and
  operate as intended, doing nothing more. Peer-review is hugely
  valuable in this regard, providing the confidence that the
  implementations are correct and sound.
- **Type safety**: The use of types is a fantastic way to ensure that
  a program cannot represent invalid states. This removes a huge set
  of potential errors and ensures greater confidence, as the compiler
  is always double-checking the code.
- **Reproducibility**: Within scientific research, being able to
  reproduce the work of another researcher is important. It's also a
  fundamental part of the scientific method. With complexities such as
  randomness, this becomes much more difficult and is generally
  extremely cumbersome. CILib must allow for the perfect replication
  of experimental work.

 With all this in mind, we can think of CILib as a platform that
 allows us to build a project by combining a number of components that
 are reinforced by type safety to ensure correctness and can be easily
 reproduced.

### Project structure

Trying to maintain a modular set of functionalities, CILib consists of
several sub-projects:

- core - Contains type class definitions together with required data
  structures.
- exec - Simplistic execution code allowing for experimental
  execution.
- de - Data structures and logic related to Differential Evolution.
- docs - Sources for the website.
- ga - Data structures and logic related to Genetic Algorithms.
- eda
- io - For CSV and parquet encoding
- moo - Type classes, instances and data structures for
  Multi-Objective Optimization.
- pso - Data structures and logic related to Particle Swarm
  Optimization.

There is also an examples sub project which offers full imputation of
algorithms as an example of how CILib is used.

### Support
If you have any feedback or questions, please contact is in #CILib on
FreeNode IRC or come chat to us in the project's Gitter channel;
alternatively, feel free to open an issue.

Another book is also in development that will be a guide to developing
for CILib. Mostly covering how to set up the developing environment as
well as offer some insight it to "behind the scenes" of how things
work.

Additional dependencies on community projects include the following:

- [Scalaz][Scalaz-link] for functional typeclasses
- [Spire][Spire-link] for mathematical typeclasses
- [Monocle][Monocle-link] for optics
- [Shapeless][Shapeless-link]
- [Refined][Refined-link]

## Conventions Used in This Book

Throughout the book you will see a lot of theory along side practical
examples represented through blocks of code.

### Typographical Conventions

- New terms and definitions will be represented in a **bold font**.
- Phrases will be represented by *itilics*.

After the initial introduction they will be written in normal font.

- Program code, filenames, and file contents, are written in
  `monospace font`.
- References to external resources are written as
  [hyperlinks][link-cilib].
- References to API documentation are written using a combination of
  hyperlinks and monospace font, for example:
  [`scala.Option`][scala.Option].

Note that we do not distinguish between singular and plural forms.
For example, might write `String` or `Strings` to refer to
`java.util.String`.

### Source Code

You will come across two different types of code blocks. The first
being a standard code block as follows.

```tut:book:silent
val number = 21 // My number
println(s"My favorite number is $number") // My message
```

The second type of code block uses [tut][link-tut] to ensure it
compiles. You can see the result of the compilation as a comment.

```tut:book
"cilib".toUpperCase
```

### Callout Boxes

We use two types of *callout box* to highlight particular content:

:::note
Tip callouts indicate handy summaries, recipes, or best practices.
:::

:::warning
Advanced callouts provide additional information
on corner cases or underlying mechanisms.
:::

:::caution
Information and insight provided from CILib docs project, written by [Gary][link-gary].
