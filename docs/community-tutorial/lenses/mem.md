## Mem

`Mem` is a data type that represents a particle's memory.
It contains only two pieces information, both which are valuable.
This information being:

- A particle's best `Position`
- A particle's velocity in the form of a `Position`

The `Mem` class is represented with the following definition/constructor:

- `Mem[A](b: Position[A], v: Position[A])`

`Mem` ins't a complex data type at all but it is very important to CILib.
We will now see why.
