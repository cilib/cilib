/**

 * Collection of different types of functions. The function classes are categorized into
 * different types:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Continuous functions</li>
 *   <li>Discrete functions</li>
 *   <li>Clustering functions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each function provides details about itself within the JavaDoc. For example, continuous
 * functions state the function properties such as:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Multi or Unimodal</li>
 *   <li>Continuous or discontinuous</li>
 *   <li>Separable or Non-separable</li>
 *   <li>Input values for the the global minimum / maximum, if it is known.</li>
 *   <li>The accepted search space domain of the function for benchmark purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
